# Poyuta

Poyuta is a Discord bot that allows you to play the `Seiyuudle` game in your Discord server. Seiyuudle is a derivative of the game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) where you have to guess the name of a seiyuu from an audio clip of them.

## Install

If you want to run your own instance of the bot, please read [INSTALL.md](/INSTALL.md).

## Usage

Once the bot is added on your server, set it up in the channel of your choice with this command :

```bash
!setchannel
```

If you want to change the channel, just run the command again.

The bot will send a new quiz every day at 18:00 UTC.
